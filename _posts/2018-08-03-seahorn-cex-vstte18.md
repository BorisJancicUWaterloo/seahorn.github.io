We have recently published a paper in the 10th Working Conference on
Verified Software: Theories, Tools and Experiments
([VSTTE'18](http://vstte18.it.uu.se/)). The paper is
titled
[Executable Counterexamples in Software Model Checking](http://seahorn.github.io/papers/cex-vstte18.pdf) and
describes in detail how SeaHorn produces executable counterexamples
which we already showed in a previous
[post](http://seahorn.github.io/seahorn/cex/validation/2016/10/16/cex-validation.html).

The slides used in the presentation can be
found
[here](http://seahorn.github.io/papers/cex-vstte18-slides.pdf). In
addition to the slides, you can watch these two videos:

- [demo 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mx2WKFbLus)
- [demo 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct1X6pmnqk0&t=43s)

Enjoy!
